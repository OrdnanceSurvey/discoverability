In particular, the column definitions for the partners' catalogue (CSV) files.

Note: following the Brownfield Site Register pattern, the CSV schema uses the definitions at https://csvlint.io/ which was developed by ODI.  This is turn uses the frictionless Json Table Schema ( https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/table-schema/ ). This is distinct from the W3C's CSV on the web (https://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-data-primer/#column-info) - but has precedent at data.gov.uk.
